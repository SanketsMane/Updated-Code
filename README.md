Update 03 Aug 2025: Hey there! If you're using Tiptap V3, there's a small change you need to make to the RenderDescription component. I won't implement it here since I don't really want to update the packages, but essentially, you now need to import generateHTML from @tiptap/html/server and remove the "use client" directive.Here’s an example repo where I made the change:
